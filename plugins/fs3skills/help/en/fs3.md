# Actions & Attributes

## Action Ratings

There are 12 **actions** in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles.

* Attune
* Command
* Consort
* Finesse
* Hunt
* Prowl
* Skirmish
* Study
* Survey
* Sway
* Tinker
* Wreck

Each action has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don't just represent skill or training—you're free to describe *how* your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at **Command** because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.

## Attribute Ratings

There are three **attributes** in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: **Insight**, **Prowess**, and **Resolve**. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.

The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the **first column** of action skills linked to that attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.


## Sheets

You can view your character sheet on the 'Sheet' tab of your web portal profile or the `sheet` command.  If your game permits it, you can also look at other character sheets in the same way.  This information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

## Rolling the Dice

*Boroughs* uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the **single highest result**.

* If the highest die is a **6**, it's a **full success**—things go well. If you roll more than one **6**, it's a **critical success**—you gain some additional advantage.
* If the highest die is a **4 or 5**, that's a **partial success**—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.
* If the highest die is **1-3**, it's a **bad outcome**. Things go poorly. You probably don't achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.

*If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, two dice will be rolled with the **lowest** result being taken.*

All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you're first learning the game, you can always "collapse" back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.

To create a dice pool for a roll, you'll use a **trait** (like your **Finesse** or your **Prowess** or your group's tier) and take dice equal to its **rating**. You'll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game—a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you'll use are the **action ratings** of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their **Skirmish** action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.

There are four types of rolls that you'll use most often in the game:

* **Action roll**. When a PC attempts an action that's dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.
* **Downtime roll**. When the PCs are at their leisure, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.
* **Fortune roll**. The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. *How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How much evidence is burned before the NYPD kick in the door?*
* **Resistance roll**. A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don't like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. *When you resist that "Broken Leg" harm, you take some stress and now it's only a "Sprained Ankle" instead.*


## Luck

Player characters in *Boroughs* have a special reserve called **Luck**. When they suffer a consequence that they don't want to accept, they can burn their luck instead. The result of the **resistance roll** determines how much luck it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

*During a knife fight, Daniel's character, Cross, gets stabbed in the chest. Daniel rolls his **Prowess** rating to resist, and gets a **2**. It costs 6 luck, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences.*

*The Guide rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cross suffers level 2 harm ("Chest Wound") instead of level 3 harm ("Punctured Lung").*

## Trauma

When a PC marks burns more luck than they have, they suffer a level of **trauma**. When you take **trauma**, a job will be automatically created in which you'll get to choose how this manifests.

When you suffer **trauma**, you're taken out of action. You're "left for dead" or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, (Not assignment. You are only out of the action until the correct obstacle is defeated or resolved) only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, your **luck** will have been refilled.

**Trauma conditions are permanent**. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth trauma condition**, your character cannot continue. It's all become too much and they must retire.


## Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) are awarded as a result of:

* **Playbook Triggers During Assignment Scenes** - For example, the Enforcer's is "Address a challenge with violence or coercion." To "address a challenge," your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn't matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.

* **You struggled with issues from your traumas** - Mark xp for this if your if a trauma condition caused you trouble during an assignment.

* **You rolled a 'desperate' action roll during an Assignment** - Considering the potential consequences of a roll from a desperate position, learning from it seems only correct. This is currently undecided as to whether that XP *must* be spent on that skill or not, and feedback is appreciated.

You can see your progression in all abilities on the "Experience" tab of your web portal character profile, or the `xp` command.

All Action Skills, no matter the level, cost 8XP to raise. Advantages cost 9XP. Banked XP maxes out at 9.

PCs not involved in an Assignment Scene in any given week can also:

* **Train as a Downtime Action** - This provides 1XP. Training cannot be used in both a PC's weekly downtime actions.
